Refs #[task number]: [Brief description of changes in English]
</template>

Use <template>.
The description should be structured: Start with the component/area affected by the changes, followed by the actual changes after a dash. It's best to use the name of the specific component being modified in this commit rather than the general task name.
Use task number from the previous commit if available or from the branch name otherwise.
