Commit comments are formatted as follows:

**Refs #[task number]: [Brief description of changes in English]**

It's recommended to structure the description. Start with the component/area affected by the changes, followed by the actual changes after a dash. It's best to use the name of the specific component being modified in this commit rather than the general task name to avoid having identical descriptions for all commits.

**Example:**

```
Refs #7782: Header template - remove separate template for homepage header
```
